# AtlasIQ Company Financial Data - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Phase 1: Backend Foundation - COMPLETE

### ✅ What's Been Built

#### 1. Database Schema (`app/models/company.py`)
Four new database tables created:

**Companies Table**
- Stores company identification, classification, and metadata
- Fields: name, country_code, NACE code, sector, ticker, website, description
- External IDs: OpenCorporates, LEI code
- Supports both listed and private companies

**Financial Statements Table**
- Annual income statement and balance sheet data
- Income: Revenue, EBITDA, EBIT, net income, expenses
- Balance Sheet: Assets, liabilities, equity, cash, debt
- All amounts standardized to EUR
- Unique constraint on (company_id, fiscal_year)

**Cash Flows Table**
- Operating, investing, and financing cash flows
- Free cash flow calculation
- CapEx, dividends, debt movements
- All amounts in EUR

**Company Risk Scores Table**
- Composite risk scoring (0-100 scale)
- Three components: Macro risk + Sector risk + Financial health
- Financial ratios: Debt/EBITDA, EBITDA margin, ROA, ROE, current ratio, etc.
- Risk categories: Low, Medium, High, Critical

#### 2. Yahoo Finance Integration (`app/services/yahoo_finance.py`)
- Async API client for fetching public company data
- Functions:
  - `get_company_info(ticker)` - Company details
  - `get_financial_statements(ticker)` - Income & balance sheet
  - `get_cashflow_statements(ticker)` - Cash flow data
- Built-in 24-hour caching
- Handles missing data gracefully
- Supports major stock exchanges (US, Europe, Asia)

#### 3. Data Normalization (`app/services/normalization.py`)
- Currency conversion to EUR (9 currencies supported)
- Field standardization and cleaning
- Validation rules:
  - EBITDA must be <= Revenue
  - Balance sheet equation check (Assets = Liabilities + Equity)
  - Outlier detection (extreme margins flagged)
- Country code normalization
- Date parsing and formatting

#### 4. Risk Scoring Engine (`app/services/company_risk.py`)
- Comprehensive risk calculation algorithm
- **Macro Risk (30%)**: Based on country economic indicators
- **Sector Risk (20%)**: Based on NACE industry benchmarks
- **Financial Health (50%)**: Based on 5 criteria:
  1. Profitability (net margin)
  2. Leverage (debt/EBITDA)
  3. Liquidity (current ratio)
  4. Cash flow quality
  5. Solvency (equity ratio)

- **Financial Ratios Calculated**:
  - Debt to EBITDA
  - EBITDA Margin
  - Return on Assets (ROA)
  - Return on Equity (ROE)
  - Current Ratio
  - Quick Ratio
  - Free Cash Flow Yield

4. **Risk Analysis API** (`/api/v1/companies/{id}/risk`)
   - Detailed risk breakdown
   - Historical risk trends
   - Peer comparison

5. **Company Comparison API** (`/api/v1/companies/compare`)
   - Side-by-side comparison of 2-5 companies
   - Key metrics table
   - Risk score comparison

6. **Data Ingestion API** (`/api/v1/companies/ingest`)
   - Admin endpoint to fetch and store company data
   - Batch processing
   - Progress tracking
